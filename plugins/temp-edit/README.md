Adds a top bar button that opens a "Temp Edit" tab powered by the Protyle Lite editor.

## Features

- Desktop only, since custom tabs rely on the desktop layout
- One click on the top bar opens the temp edit tab; clicking again switches to the opened tab
- Uses Protyle Lite, so Markdown WYSIWYG input, the slash menu and block references all work
- Content is **not saved anywhere**, and it is gone after closing the tab, quitting SiYuan or refreshing the page
- Copy the content as Markdown or clear it with one click

## Why nothing is persisted

- Protyle runs with `lite: true`, so edit transactions are recorded by the frontend `LocalUndo` and `/api/transactions` is never called
- The editor has no block ID (`blockId: ""`), so it neither reads nor writes any document
- The upload URL is empty, so pasting images and other assets fails instead of writing to `data/assets`
- The content only lives in the memory of the current page, so it is written neither to the workspace `data/` nor to browser local storage
